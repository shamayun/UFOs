# UFOs
### Overview of Project: 
The purpose of the project was to create a webpage and dynamic table with filters using JavaScript and Bootstrap.
### Results: 
I’ve created 3 JavaScript functions in app.js: to build table from given dataset, to get values from filters provided by user and to filter the table.

Then I’ve created the webpage using Bootstrap and added the script to make a table dynamic. Now user can filter the table based on 5 criteria: date, city, state, country and shape of UFO. I filled every field with a placeholder for better understanding of expected values. I used style.css to adjust a font color for body text and jumbotron background image.
### Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
