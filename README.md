# UFOs
### Overview of Project: 
The purpose of the project was to create a webpage and dynamic table with filters using JavaScript and Bootstrap.
### Results: 
I’ve created 3 JavaScript functions in app.js: to build table from given dataset, to get values from filters provided by user and to filter the table.

Then I’ve created the webpage using Bootstrap and added the script to make a table dynamic. Now user can filter the table based on 5 criteria: date, city, state, country and shape of UFO. I filled every field with a placeholder for better understanding of expected values. I used style.css to adjust a font color for body text and jumbotron background image.
### Summary: 
Upon full deployment of the web application, I find there to be a drawback in which data is provided in the back-end. A great future update may include a script to get "live/dynamic data" or a method of scraping data so that new data is easily and efficiently added.

Additionally, I would like to further develop the layout and design of the web page to make it more streamlined and enhanced.
